## My process

Start with mobile-first design. Since everything is portrait, I did not have to worry about doing it in rows to begin with. Using Grid and inline-flex when neccessary (like the button), I worked my way down creating the right CSS properities for each line of text. Firefox Developer Edition has a great tool for customizing the font in the browser which was really helpful since this is entirely based on a JPG file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Inline-flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned how to properly configure media queries and use the `<picture>` element to dynamically set images based on a media query.

### Continued development

I really want to continue working on cleaning up my code and writing better semantic HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's video on this challenge](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ) - I watched this after my first attempt at this challenge and then went a few days to see if I could replicate what Kevin did without straight up copying. I learned a lot from this practice and has made me much more confident in my CSS ability.
- [MDN accessibility concerns regarding the strikethrough element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s#accessibility_concerns) - I preferred this approach to Kevin Powell's as it is cleaner.
